# High-Stakes Adversarial-Verification Workflow Template

This is the reusable orchestration script the `high-stakes` skill runs for medium/large tasks. Copy
the script below and adapt it — do not re-derive the structure each invocation. The adaptation points
are all near the top:

- **Fill the inputs** (`TASK`, `ARTIFACT`, `PLAN`, `DIFF`, `ARTIFACT_KIND`, `TIER`) from the run.
    `PLAN` is your Phase-1 plan verbatim (Assumptions with their `[verified:…]`/`[UNVERIFIED]` tags,
    Questions, Conflicts) — the gauntlet checks the work against it. `DIFF` is the `git diff` of the
    edits (or before/after of each touched file); orthogonal damage and dead code are only visible here.
    `ARTIFACT_KIND` is `"code"` or `"prose"` and switches the correctness check.
- **Scale the panel** via the `.filter(...)` on `PANEL`: drop a mode that genuinely cannot apply to
    this task, but never prune `dead-code-sweeper` or `scope-diff-reviewer` when the artifact is code.
- The `export const meta` header and everything below the inputs are fixed machinery: the verdict
    schema, the guilty-until-clean prompts, the user-decision escalation, and the two-clean-rounds loop.
    Leave them intact (`meta` is required — every Workflow script must start with it).

## Design contract

- **Guilty until proven clean.** Every skeptic assumes its mode IS present and tries to prove it. It
    returns `clean: true` only when it has actively confirmed the artifact is free of its mode, with the
    evidence its schema demands — otherwise it defaults to a finding.
- **One skeptic, one mode.** Single-assignment agents catch what a generalist rationalizes away.
- **Evidence, not assertion.** Correctness must paste a real test command + result; simplicity must
    name the simpler construction it searched for; tradeoffs must enumerate the alternatives first;
    sycophancy runs the strip-test on the conversational prose. A bare `clean: true` is rejected.
- **User-decision findings escalate, never repair.** A genuine 50/50, an unresolved contradiction, or
    a flawed premise (modes #2, #3, #5) is put to the user with `AskUserQuestion` — the autonomous fixer
    may not pick a side, because that just launders a guess into settled prose.
- **Two-clean-rounds stop.** Loop until two consecutive fully clean rounds, or the budget is
    exhausted (then report unresolved findings — never fake convergence).
- **Determinism.** No wall-clock time, no randomness; fan-out is fixed by the triage decision, not
    computed from anything nondeterministic.

## The panel

| Skeptic              | Failure mode (code)      | What it must prove / produce                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| assumption-hunter    | silent-assumptions       | Re-open each `[verified:…]` evidence; flag any decision absent from the plan or any `[UNVERIFIED]` built on silently |
| confusion-auditor    | unmanaged-confusion      | A genuine 50/50 was silently resolved instead of asked (user-decision)                                               |
| inconsistency-finder | hidden-inconsistencies   | Re-derive contradictions from the independent sources; each must be surfaced, not reconciled (user-decision)         |
| tradeoff-checker     | unsurfaced-tradeoffs     | First enumerate the alternatives, then show each was surfaced or rejected                                            |
| premise-challenger   | no-pushback              | A flawed premise was implemented faithfully instead of challenged (user-decision)                                    |
| sycophancy-detector  | sycophancy               | Strip-test the plan + report prose; flag if no judgment survives the cut                                             |
| correctness-tester   | subtle-conceptual-errors | Paste the real edge/boundary/concurrency test command, exit code, and cases                                          |
| simplicity-reviewer  | overcomplication         | Name the simplest construction found; show the artifact is at or near it                                             |
| dead-code-sweeper    | dead-code                | Diff for symbols/imports/branches/comments introduced or orphaned, never used                                        |
| scope-diff-reviewer  | orthogonal-damage        | Walk the diff hunk by hunk; flag any change the task did not require                                                 |

For prose/research artifacts, remap 7–10: correctness-tester → fact/logic checker (trace each claim
to a source), simplicity-reviewer → padding/hedging cutter, dead-code-sweeper → unsupported-claim
remover, scope-diff-reviewer → out-of-scope-edit reviewer.

${ARTIFACT}

Phase-1 plan (assumptions claimed with their verification status, questions, conflicts):
${PLAN}

Diff of the edits (review THIS for anything outside scope; the final file hides deletions):
${DIFF}

Rules of engagement:
- Inspect the REAL inputs (open the actual files/data/sources). Do not judge from assumptions.
- Your review target includes the agent's plan and delivery prose, not just the code — for the
  sycophancy check, run the strip-test on that conversational text.
- For correctness on code, verify behaviorally and paste the real test command, exit code, and edge
  cases into testEvidence; clean:true is invalid without it. For prose, trace claims to sources.
- For overcomplication, clean:true is invalid unless simplerConstruction names the minimal design you
  searched for and shows the artifact is at/near it; flag every layer/abstraction/knob with one caller.
- For unsurfaced-tradeoffs, list the alternatives you generated before judging coverage; an empty
  findings list is invalid without that enumeration.
- For orthogonal-damage, walk the DIFF hunk by hunk and state for each whether the task required it;
  if no diff was provided, that itself is a blocker finding.
- Set needs_user_decision: true if a finding is a genuine 50/50, an unresolved contradiction, or a
  flawed premise that only the user can settle — do not pick a side yourself.
- Default to a finding when you cannot positively confirm the artifact is free of your mode. Silence
  must be earned. An empty findings list means you actively looked and there is genuinely nothing.
Return only the schema object.`;

## Notes

- `parallel(...)` is used because the per-mode skeptics are independent and each wants the whole
    artifact, plan, and diff. Use `pipeline(...)` only if you stream many separate artifacts (e.g.
    file-by-file) through the same skeptic stages.
- For large code changes, give skeptics `isolation: "worktree"` if they run builds/tests so they do
    not step on each other.
- Pick `model`/`agentType` per skeptic if cost matters: cheap models for mechanical sweeps (dead code,
    scope diff), stronger models for conceptual correctness, tradeoff, and premise judgment.
- The two-clean-rounds rule is the margin against a skeptic that went easy once; do not lower it to
    one on a high-stakes task.
- The loop deliberately has three terminal states: converged, halted-for-user-decision, and
    budget-exhausted. Only the first is a pass — report the other two honestly.

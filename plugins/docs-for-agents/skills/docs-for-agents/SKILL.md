# Docs for Agents

Generate or update a "For Coding Agents" reference page — a compressed, prescriptive
reference optimized for AI coding agents working on or integrating with the project.

## Principles

- **Dense and declarative.** Tables and code blocks over prose.
- **Action-oriented.** Constraint catalogs, decision dispatch, task recipes, change playbooks.
- **Consistent terminology.** Match the codebase exactly — no synonyms.
- **Self-contained.** An agent should not need to read other docs to act correctly.
- **Cross-referenced.** Link to existing docs where agents need deeper context.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze the codebase

Read all source files to extract:

- File layout and what each file contains
- Class/module hierarchy
- Import dependency graph
- Public API surface (`__all__`, exports, entry points)
- Constructor constraints and validation rules
- Method signatures, side effects, and state mutations
- Concurrency model and thread-safety rules
- Persistence behavior (what writes to disk, what resets state)
- Key invariants that are not obvious from type signatures

### 2. Check existing documentation infrastructure

Identify:

- Documentation framework and config (e.g., `mkdocs.yml`, `zensical.toml`, `docs/` layout)
- Navigation structure — where to add the new page
- LLM doc generation scripts (e.g., `gen_llms_full.py`, `llms.txt` generators)
- Existing pages to cross-reference

### 3. Write the reference page

Create the page with these sections (omit any that don't apply to the project):

#### Architecture map

- **File layout** — table: file path → what it contains
- **Class/module hierarchy** — text tree showing inheritance/composition
- **Import dependency flow** — A → B → C diagram
- **Public API exports** — what's in `__all__` or equivalent

#### Decision dispatch

- Tables mapping use-case → class/function/method
- One table per decision axis (e.g., "which class?", "which method?", "which config?")

#### Constraints and invariants

- Concurrency rules
- Input constraints (types, ranges, alignment, dtypes)
- Key/ID constraints
- State machine semantics (counters, flags, lifecycle)
- Resource management rules

#### Side effects catalog

- Table: method → disk writes, state mutations, cache updates, counter changes
- Cover all public methods that mutate state

#### Task recipes

- Step-by-step code examples for common integration tasks
- Patterns for typical workflows

#### Change playbook

- "If modifying X → also update Y, Z" checklists
- Cover every module/subsystem where a change has non-obvious ripple effects

#### Common mistakes

- NEVER / ALWAYS format
- Concrete negative examples with corrections
- Each mistake separated by a horizontal rule for scannability

### 4. Register the page

- Add to documentation navigation config
- Add to LLM doc generation scripts if they exist
- Verify build succeeds

### 5. Verify

- Build the docs site — confirm the page renders and nav link works
- Run any LLM doc generators — confirm the page is included in output
- Review for accuracy against the source code

## Updating an existing page

When updating rather than creating:

1. Read the current for-coding-agents page
2. Read all source files to identify what changed since the page was written
3. Update affected sections — do not rewrite sections that are still accurate
4. Verify the build still passes

## File naming

Use `for-coding-agents.md` as the filename to avoid conflicts with the `AGENTS.md`
convention (which serves a different purpose at the repo root).
